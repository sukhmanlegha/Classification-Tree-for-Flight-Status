# Classification-Tree-for-Flight-Status
This project revolves around the development of a classification tree to predict flight status, distinguishing between 'delayed' and 'ontime', using a dataset that includes various predictor variables. The initial phase involves data preprocessing, including data upload, exploration, and cleaning. Categorical variables are transformed, and unnecessary columns are removed. The subsequent steps encompass the creation of training and validation partitions, training a DecisionTreeClassifier with specified parameters, and explaining flight outcomes based on specific conditions. Confusion matrices are generated to evaluate the model's performance.

Furthermore, the project employs grid search optimization to enhance the classification tree's control parameters, considering factors like maximum depth, minimum impurity decrease, and minimum number of node records. The improved parameters are presented, and the associated classification tree is displayed. The final stage involves a comparative analysis of confusion matrices between different models, providing insights into their accuracy rates. A recommendation is then made based on the evaluation, suggesting the preferred classification tree model for making predictions regarding flight status.
